wa-proximityreminder
====================

A webinos app for creating reminders based on where you are and what time it is.

To make the application into a widget, simply zip the contents of the 
repository.  You can also (for convenience) use the included createwgt.sh
shell script.

Warning: at present this doesn't work on Chrome because Chrome doesn't support
the FileAPI if you are using it from a file.
